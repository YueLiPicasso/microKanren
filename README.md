# My Reproduction of microKanren

Compared with the [official implementation](https://github.com/jasonhemann/microKanren), the (albeit small) novelty of my reproduction here is using the syntactic forms `delay` ,`inved` and `force` to highlight in the source code the techniques of (infinite) stream processing, viz., _delay_ (a.k.a. suspension/continuation), _inverse-eta-delay_ and _force_, respectively.

The terminology follows:
